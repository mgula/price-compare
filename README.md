Mock-up of a grocery shopping tool using Swing and AWT in Java. 

The final product would use an actual interactive mapping API, and would pull data directly from stores to provide continuous real-time pricing and availability information.

For now, the application uses a screenshot of Google Maps and draws over that image.

To run, I've included a rough-around-the-edges launcher script (uses javac - it may prompt you to install a Java SDK or similar). Try

`chmod 754 launcher.sh`

and then

`./launcher.sh`
